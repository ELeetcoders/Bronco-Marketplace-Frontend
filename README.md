# Bronco Marketplace Frontend

As part of the Cal Poly Pomona CS4800 class, we created an online marketplace for CPP students to buy and sell items & services. This was a team project done by members: Uzi Gaeta, Tyler Nimjeh, and [Michael Truong](https://github.com/michael-m-truong) 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

## Problem statement

* Need a safe way to buy and sell academic resources on campus
  * Textbooks
  * Electronics
  * Furniture & appliances
  * Academic/tech services
* Needs to be campus-specific, with meetup times and locations
* Need reimbursement for purchases that wonâ€™t be used anymore
* Easy to find/request what you need


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
